            <p class="paragraph">
            Even though the wind turbine manufacturing market is dominated by few companies, the competitive level in this industry is still high and continuing to increase. Some companies focus on wind turbines only and some are part of large multinational companies, so they use different business strategies to position themselves in the market by their competitive advantage. Wind turbine manufacturers compete with each other on price (through alterations in manufacturing processes, distribution arrangements, etc.) and product quality. Companies that can provide effective differentiated technologies and wind turbine design generally attract more customers.

            <div class="section_subheading">Threat of New Entrants (Low and Steady)</div>
            <p class="paragraph">
            The wind turbine manufacturing industry requires a large amount of capital in the form of plant and equipment. The turbine manufacturing industry is currently led by three major long-standing American and European manufacturers; as these companies have substantial expertise, knowledge, and research and development capacity, threat of new entrants in this industry is considered very low.

            <div class="section_subheading">Threat of Substitutes (High and increasing)</div>
            <p class="paragaph">
            Potential substitutes for wind power include other renewable energy sources (e.g., utility-scale solar, hydro, geothermal, and biofuel) and traditional carbon-intensive fossil fuel options. Among renewable sources, wind energy faces competition from decreasing solar energy costs following government support, technological breakthrough, and returns to economies-of-scale in solar panel production. Wind energy also faces competition from fossil fuel generators. In recent years, low U.S. natural gas prices have contributed to an increase in natural gas power, which has displaced a great amount of coal-fired energy generation and may pose a competitive threat to wind power if its price remains low.

            <div class="section_subheading">Bargaining Power of Suppliers (Low and Increasing)</div>
            <p class="paragraph">
            The bargaining power of suppliers decreases when an industry can control their suppliers either by acquiring them (vertical integration) or by negotiating long-term commitments. Vertical integration allows wind turbine manufacturers to control of the quality and delivery of raw material and components; however, vertical integration may pose a risk to manufacturers during economic downturns because it reduces their ability to adjust production capacity quickly. Given the recent market fluctuations due to policy uncertainties, some wind turbine manufacturers have restructured organizationally to purchase more components from external suppliers.
            <span class="footnote" ref="supplier_naics" note="Key industries that supply components to wind turbine manufacturers: Aluminum Manufacturing (NAICS 33131), Circuit Board & Electronic Component Manufacturing (NAICS 33441b), Engine & Turbine Manufacturing (NAICS 33361a), Iron & Steel Manufacturing (NAICS 33111), Semiconductor & Circuit Manufacturing (NAICS 33441a), Steel Framing (NAICS 23812), Steel Rolling & Drawing (NAICS 33122)"></span>

            <p class="paragraph">
            </p>
            There are two type of buyers of wind turbines: 1) the owner of the wind power project, and 2) buyers of wind-generated electricity. Typically a wind power project is purchased by a utility company, local government, or investment company. They are constantly evaluating all the factors that will affect the profitability of the project. Transition to power auction also help lower the costs per unit of electricity generated by on-shore wind projects, which further squeeze down the profit that wind turbine manufacturers can make.

    Due to market uncertainty caused by the expiration of the Production Tax Credit (PTC)
    <span class="footnote" ref="ptc" note="Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which provides corporate tax credit for several renewable sources including wind. The credit originally expired seven years later in 1999, causing a near halt in production. The PTC has since been expanded and extended several times through various policies. The current tax credits, extended to 2019,began to phase out in the beginning of 2017 by decreasing 20 percent each year."></span> at the end of 2012, total new wind project capacity installed during 2013 dropped by 92% and many smaller turbine manufacturers were forced to reassess their position in the U.S. market. A series of market consolidations has taken place since then, including the significant 2016 merger of Nordex and Acciona Windpower, as well as the recent merger of Gamesa and Siemens (effective in April 2017).  Going forward, the industry will likely continue to be dominated by a few major turbine manufacturers. In total, eight different turbine manufacturers installed wind turbines in the U.S. in 2016, though the top four accounted for 99% of the market.<span class="footnote" ref="gemesa_siemens" note="The merger of Gamesa and Siemens was not effective yet in 2016; hence, they were counted as two separate turbine manufacturers."</span>
    Table SC.1 summarizes the market shares of installed wind capacity by major manufacturer in 2016. Table SC.2 summarizes some of the major acquisition events that took place in the wind turbine manufacturing industry in recent years.

    <p class="paragraph">
    The distribution of wind turbine manufacturing establishments has little correlation with the distribution of downstream wind power production. The states with the greatest levels of wind power production tend to have large swaths of rural, open land, where greater energy can be extracted from unobstructed wind. These locations are not always ideal for manufacturing facilities. The exception to this trend is Texas, which is both the nation's leading producer of wind power and a top destination for turbine manufacturers, with 8.1% of industry-related establishments.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
    As shown in Figure SC.1, the majority of wind projects are concentrated in regions with abundant wind sources, such as the Great Plains, the Midwest, and the state of Texas. In these areas, wind energy contributed 55% or more of all new electricity generation capacity between 2012 and 2016. In 2016, 89% of the 8,203 MW total wind capacity was installed either in the Plains, the Midwest or Texas. However, due to advances in rotor blade design, larger rotor diameters allow for viable wind projects in regions with lower wind speeds, including many parts of the Great Lakes, the Northeast, and the Southeast.
    </p>

    <div id="fig_SC.1"></div>

    <p class="paragraph">
    The Great Lakes region has the highest concentration of wind-related manufacturing activity, accounting for an estimated 31.7% of industry establishments and suppliers. Many of the components in wind turbines are similar to those used in engines and other auto parts. As a result, industry suppliers are concentrated here due to the region's historic dominance of the auto sector. Additionally, industry manufacturers in this region are situated close to Canada, the industry's largest export market, as well as the Plains region, where an estimated 23.5% of the United States installed wind power capacity is located. Ohio is estimated to lead both the region and the nation in the industry-related manufacturing, with 11.1% of total establishments. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
    The Southeast accounts for the second-largest share of industry-related manufacturing establishments, with an estimated 20.7%. Similar to the Great Lakes region, the concentration of industry-related manufacturing in this region has less to do with downstream demand than with the presence in the region of similar industries; the Southeast, for example, also has the second-highest concentration of automobile engine and parts manufacturing activity. In addition, the region has ready access to ports that supply components to fast-growing wind power markets in Europe. Within the region, North Carolina has the highest number of establishments, with an estimated 4.9% of the national total.

    <div class="section_heading">Overview of Governance (as it relates to imperfect competition)</div>
    <p class="paragraph">
    State and federal mandates and policy incentives for renewable energy have been the primary drivers of demand for wind turbines, vital in reducing the cost of wind power to a level that is price-competitive with more conventional carbon-intensive energy sources. The major wind turbine components, such as blades, nacelles and towers are very large, so overseas shipments of these components are not economical for wind turbine manufacturers. However, many of the internal components of wind turbines are traded internationally. In recent years, greater demand for wind energy production has led to a greater share of domestic U.S. production of turbines and internal components.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
    The most influential policy incentive supporting U.S. wind energy has been the Production Tax Credit (PTC). The PTC supports wind and other renewable energy projects, keeping renewable generation competitive with fossil fuels and sustaining demand for turbines. When PTC was enacted in 1992 as a part of the Energy Policy Act, it provided an adjusted tax credit of 1.5 cent per kWh of wind-generated electricity. The PTC requires periodic renewal by Congress, and since its inception several lapses have occurred, resulting in subsequent breaks in new wind project construction. In the end of 2015, Congress passed the most recent extension of the tax credit with bipartisan support. The legislation allows wind projects under construction as of 2015 and 2016 to receive a full tax credit of 2.4 cents per kWh. It then calls for a phasedown of the credit through a 20.0% reduction each year through 2019, when the credit will expire. 
    </p>


    <p class="paragraph">
    In July 2012, the U.S. Department of Commerce established tariffs against Chinese and Vietnamese manufacturers of wind towers, which was the first ever import tariff in the wind manufacturing industry. According to the Department of Commerce, these overseas manufacturers were selling the towers below the cost of production and "dumping" them into the U.S. market because of an oversupply in their respective countries. The tariff for Chinese manufacturers are between 20.9% and 72.7%, while tariffs on Vietnamese manufacturers vary between 52.7% and 59.9%.
    </p>


    <p class="paragraph">
    On the state level, renewable portfolio standards (RPS) require utilities to generate a certain portion of their electricity from renewable sources, including wind. These requirements vary by state; currently 29 states and the District of Columbia have established renewable portfolio standards (Figure SC.2). RPS requirements are thought to be responsible for 60% of the total increase in U.S. renewable electricity generation since 2000. RPSs' role appears to have declined in recent years from 71% of new U.S. renewable energy projects in 2013 to 46% in 2015.<span class="reference" ref="barbose_2017"></span>
