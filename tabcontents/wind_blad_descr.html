    <p class="paragraph">
    Wind turbine blades are advanced in design, but labor intensive in the manufacturing process. OEMs usually have unique designs for blades. Manufacturing includes labor intensive processes like adding layers of fiberglass to blade molds and finishing the edges of blades. It takes about one week to produce a blade.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
    Types of Blade Manufacturers: (1) OEMs with in-house production facilities, (2) Established European suppliers, (3) U.S. manufacturers, and (4) Suppliers outside of Europe and the United States.

    <p class=paragraph">
    Many OEMs produce some blades in-house, but the extent of vertical integration varies by manufacturer. Some companies outsource all blades (e.g., Clipper), while other OEMs produce all of their blades in-house (e.g., Suzlon). Most companies fall somewhere between these two extremes. OEMs usually have their own blade design and outside suppliers produce blades to their specifications. (USITC) Global supply is currently dominated by LM Glasfiber with a market share of around 27% but all the major manufacturers apart from GE Energy, Clipper and REpower produce the majority of their blades.

    <div class="section_heading">NAICS Codes</div>
    <p class=paragraph">
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are standard definitions of industries.  These codes are often used to present industry-level data, such as in the U.S. Economic Census.  Unfortunately, even at their most disaggregated level (six-digit codes), a single NAICS code often covers a range of related components, products or services.
    </p>
    <span class="tbd">Note: are these the right naics codes? Engine+turbine probably is more to do with steam and gas turbines than wind.</span>

    Three wind turbine manufacturers dominate the U.S. wind energy industry. GE Renewable Energy, Vestas, and Siemens collectively represent 79% of the U.S. wind fleet. Recent market consolidation, including the 2016 merger of Nordex and Acciona Windpower, as well as the impending merger of Gamesa and Siemens, suggests the industry will continue to be dominated by a few major turbine manufacturers.</p>
    <p class=paragraph">
    As a result of the market uncertainty caused by the expiration of the PTC at the end of 2012, many smaller OEMs were forced to reconsider their position in the U.S. market. Following the eventual extension of the PTC in early 2013, the top three OEMs were well-positioned to execute quickly. Consequently, 93% of wind capacity installed since 2012 came in the form of GE Renewable Energy, Vestas, and Siemens wind turbines.</p>
    <p class=paragraph">
    #3 Cumulatively, GE Renewable Energy retains a 42% market share of U.S. wind power capacity, followed by Vestas with 22%, and Siemens with 14%. These three OEMs represent 79% of all installed wind turbine capacity, while the top five OEMs represent 89% and the top ten represent 99% of the U.S. wind fleet.<span class="reference" ref="awea_2016a"></span>
