    Though a typical wind turbine comprises a variety of modules and components, there is a well-established consensus around the definition of basic wind turbine architecture, which has three blades that rotate on a horizontal-axis, faces upwind, and allows for variable speeds and pitch regulation. This dominant wind turbine design outperforms other alternatives by achieving higher reliability and efficiency, and can be produced at lower cost. In contrast to this fixed architecture, the technology of the drive train has become a focus for innovation, leading to a variety of alternative configurations<span class="reference" ref="jamieson_2011"></span>. We provide more detailed discussion separately on the dominant design and technology innovation for each sub-step of the turbine manufacturing value chain step (rotor module, nacelle module, and tower module).

    <p class="paragraph">
    In addition to the technological advancement in turbine components, major turbine manufacturers also invest in the improvement of software platforms that can streamline wind farm operations, reduce maintenance costs, and optimize wind resources, further decreasing the levelized cost of electricity for wind energy. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
    Recent advances in wind turbine technologies and siting techniques have contributed to a substantial increase in the average nameplate capacity of newly installed wind turbines. The average capacity rating of a wind turbine installed in 2016 was 2.15 MW, an increase of 20% from 1.80 MW in 2010<span class="reference" ref="doe_2016"></span>. Simultaneously, technological advances in the electronic components used in turbines have improved turbine reliability.

    <p class="paragraph">
    Rotor diameters have increased significantly in the past two decades, and the hub height has increased slightly. The average turbine installed in 2016 grew slightly to 83 meters in hub height and stretched to 108 meters in rotor diameter, an increase of nearly 29% as compared to average turbine installations in 2010<span class="reference" ref="doe_2016"></span>. Figure IO.1 depicts the overall trends of wind turbine capacity and average rotor diameter and hub height in the past two decades.

    <p class="paragraph">
    Rotor diameter and hub height are the two major elements impacting the project-level capacity factor, wind turbine performance measure.<span class="footnote" ref="wind_turb_cf" note="The capacity factor is calculated by diviing the average power generated by the nameplate capacity."></span>
    Larger rotor diameters enable greater swept area of the blades, resulting in greater energy capture for each watt of rated turbine capacity<span class="footnote" ref="wind_turb_sp_pwr" note="A wind turbine's specific power is the ratio of its nameplate capacity rating to its rotor-swept area. The longer the rotor diameter, the lower the specific power is for a wind turbine. All else equal, a lower specific power leads to an increase in capacity factor."></span>.
    Increasing hub heights allows wind turbines to access steadier wind speed profiles at higher altitudes, which improves energy production for a given turbine rating and rotor diameter. With advancements in average rotor diameter and hub height, the performance of wind turbines has improved over time, as indicated by the upward trend in capacity factor in Figure IO.2.<span class="footnote" ref="io2_exp" note="Actual capacity factors in Figure IO.2 account for losses from curtailment, less than full availability, wake effects, icing, soiling, etc."></span>

    The cost of wind energy can be considered in several ways, including 
    turbine price, wind power project code, and levelized cost of electricity
    (LCOE) produce from wind. Table IO.1, Table IO.2, and Figure IO.4 include
    historical data on cumulative wind capacity, wind energy costs, and 
    various quality attribute measurements that can be used as inputs for
    developing learning curve analysis for wind energy.

    The total project cost of onshore wind energy has fallen significantly over time thanks to cost reduction in equipment, technology improvements and heighten competition in the industry.<span class="reference" ref=""></span>
    The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) provides updated global learning curves for the installed costs of onshore wind power and the levelized cost of wind-based electricity (LCOE) for the period 1983-2014. The analysis examined 12 counties, including Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The preliminary results show a global learning rates of 12% for LCOE between 1983 and 2014, suggesting significant improvements in global wind technology over the period (Figure IO.5).<span class="reference" ref="irena_2018"></span><sup>,</sup><span class="reference" ref="irena_2017"></span>
     Wiser et al. (2016) used the historical LCOE for onshore wind in the U.S. to derive a learning curve rate of 17.8%<span class="reference" ref="wiser_2016"></span>(Figure IO.6).
