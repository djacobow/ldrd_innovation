    <p class="paragraph">
    The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), defined of the sum of the squares of the market share fraction of all firms in an industry, measures industry competitiveness. A score of 10,000 indicates perfect monopoly. Scores below 1000 reflect a generall unconcentrated (competitive) market.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
    Overall HHI for wind turbine blades is 1924.39.

    <div class="section_subheading">Four Firm Concentration Ratio (FFCR)</div>
    <p class="parapgrah">
    This measure is a simplified alternative to the HHI, which measures percent
    of total industry revenue accruing to the largest four firms in the 
    industry. Concentration ratios are usually used to show the extend of 
    market control of the largest firms in the industry, and to illustrate
    the degree to which the industry is oligopolistic.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
    <ol>
        <li>Low concentration (0-50%) &mdash; This category ranges from perfect competition to oligopoly.</li>
        <li>Medium concentation (50-80%) &mdash; Industry is likely an oligopoly.</li>
        <li>High concentation (80100%) &mdash; Industry is an oligopoly or monopoly.</li>

    <p class="paragraph">
The federal renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC)
is a per-kilowatt-hour tax credit for electricity generated by
qualified energy resources. In 2009, renewable energy project
developers were also given a choice to instead elect an up-front
cost-based investment tax credit (ITC) based on the initial
amount invested in a project. At the beginning of 2013, the
deadline for eligibility for the production and investment tax
credits was extended through 2013, and the terms were changed
so that start of construction rather than placed in service
became the basis for eligibility. Another extension was passed
at the end of 2014 such that eligibility was extended to projects
that demonstrated initiation of construction by end of 2014. A
“safe harbor” clause will provide eligibility for projects that
are operational by end of year 2016. In addition to the PTC,
investors in most new renewable power generation projects are
able to accelerate the depreciation of the renewable project
assets. This enables them to defer related federal taxable
income and obligations in the early years of the projects.
Together, the tax credits and the accelerated depreciation
compose what is referred to as the “tax benefits” of a renewable
project. In 2009, after the 2008 global financial crisis,
Congress responded to the lack of tax equity investors with a
provision to allow developers to claim a cash payment in lieu
of the taxdependent ITC or PTC. The program entitled project
developers to receive 30% of a project’s capital cost in the
form of an upfront cash payment (notionally the same value as
the ITC mentioned previously). This freed developers from having
to rely as extensively on tax equity investors to monetize the
federal tax credits and attracted new investors to the market
(Mendelsohn et al. 2012). The cash grant program expired on 31
December 2011, with projects that started construction prior
to that date eligible to receive the award. At the end of 2014,
RPS policies existed in 29 states and Washington D.C. An RPS
is a requirement that a certain amount of electricity come from
renewable sources. Given the rapid growth in renewable generation
over the last decade, however, near-term incremental RPS demand
is somewhat modest: existing laws are projected to drive average
annual renewable energy additions of just 3–4 GW/yr between
2013 and 2025, only a portion of which will be from wind (Wiser
and Bolinger 2014).<span class="reference" ref="ieawind_2016"></span>

    <p class="paragraph">
The U.S. wind energy supply chain contains eight utility-scale blade 
facilities, nine tower facilities, and four turbine nacelle assembly
facilities, all spread across 14 states.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
Major manufacturing facilities have the capability to produce approximately 
11,700 MW of turbine nacelles, more than 11,000 individual blades, 
and around 3,150 towers annually.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
The Southeast, while not a major wind project development region currently, 
is a true wind manufacturing hub, with more than 100 facilities that 
supply components and materials to the industry.</p>

    <div class="section_heading">Vertical Integration</div>
    <p class="paragraph">
Many blade OEMs produce some blades in-house, but the extent of
vertical integration varies by manufacturer (figure 3). Some companies
outsource all blades (e.g., Clipper), while other OEMs produce all
of their blades in-house (e.g., Suzlon). Most companies fall somewhere
between these two extremes. OEMs usually have their own blade design
and outside suppliers produce blades to their specifications.<span class="reference" ref="merrill_lynch"></span>
