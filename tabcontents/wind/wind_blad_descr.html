    <p class="paragraph">
    The rotor module includes both the rotor blades and the rotor hub. Rotor blades convert wind energy to low speed rotational energy. The rotor hub, to which the rotor blades are bolted, allows blades to rotate in varying wind speeds. Most manufacturers create multiple blade types for a single type of turbine to ensure that the turbine can perform most efficiently in all wind conditions. The rotor module accounted for approximately 20% of the cost of an on-shore wind power project in 2015 (NREL 2017)<span class="reference" ref="nrel_2015"></span>.

    <p class="paragraph">
    There are two major types of rotor blade original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the U.S.: (1) OEMs with in-house production capabilities, and (2) established European suppliers investing in production in the U.S. GE Renewable Energy, LM Wind Power, Molded Fiber Glass, Siemens, TPI Composites, and Vestas make up the vast majority of rotor blade manufacturing capacity in the U.S. As of 2016, there are eight blade manufacturing facilities in operation in the U.S., capable of producing approximately 11,300 individual blades annually. In October 2016, GE Renewable Energy announced plans to acquire blade manufacturer LM Wind Power, and the merger was completed in 2017 (AWEA 2016)<span class="reference" ref="awea_2016a"></span>.

	The rotor blade manufacturing in the value chain is covered by “Turbine and Turbine Generator Set Units Manufacturing” (NAICS 333611)<span class="footnote" ref="wind_naics_defs1" note="The “Turbine and Turbine Generator Set Units Manufacturing” industry (NAICS 333611) comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing turbines (except aircraft); and complete turbine generator set units, such as steam, hydraulic, gas, and wind."></span>. As reported in the 2012 Economic Census, there are 183 establishments and 36,955 employees covered under this industry, with a value of shipments of 16.9 billion dollars. However, even at their most disaggregated level (six-digit code), each of the NAICS code covers a range of components, products, and services beyond those specific to tower manufacturing.
