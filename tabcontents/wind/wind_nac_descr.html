    <p class="paragraph">
    The box-like nacelle module is considered the heart of a wind turbine. It sits on top of the tower and is connected to the rotor. The nacelle is usually made of fiberglass and houses the drivetrain. The drivetrain is responsible for converting the low speed incoming rotation to high speed rotation that the generator needs to begin producing electricity. The drivetrain is typically composed of the rotor shaft, gearbox and generator. In addition, the nacelle also contains a yaw drive system and a control system. The yaw drive ensures the rotor is always facing into the wind, and the control system adjusts the pitch angle of the blades under different wind speeds to prevent structural damage to the wind turbine<span class="reference" ref="serrano_2016"></span>.

    <p class="paragraph">
    Nacelles are produced in assembly facilities. There are four components of nacelle production: (1) nacelle structural assembly, (2) drivetrain assembly, (3) nacelle electrical assembly, and (4) yaw assembly. According to the cost report by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the nacelle module accounted for approximately 36% of the total cost of an on-shore wind power project in 2015<span class="reference" ref="nrel_2015"></span>.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
    Nacelle components are either produced in-house or by outside suppliers to the specifications of the nacelle original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and then the components are assembled at the nacelle plant. Many foreign OEMs are localizing nacelle production in the United States to take advantage of the growing market and reduce transport7ation costs and logistical challenges.

	<p class="paragraph">
    GE Renewable Energy, Siemens, Vestas, and Phoenix are the four major wind turbine nacelle assembly manufacturers with production facilities located in the United States. As of 2016, these major nacelle assembly facilities are capable of producing approximately 11,700 MW of turbine nacelles annually<span class="reference" ref="awea_2016b"></span>.
