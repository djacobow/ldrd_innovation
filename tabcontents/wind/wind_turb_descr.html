    <p class="paragraph">
    An on-shore wind turbine is typically composed of three modules: (1) rotor, (2) nacelle, and (3) tower. A more detailed anatomy of a typical wind turbine can be found in Figure DI.1. Wind turbines account for approximately 71% of the total cost of an on-shore wind power project as of 2015 <span class="reference" ref="nrel_2015"></span>
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
    The main business activities of turbine manufacturers are designing, manufacturing, and installing wind turbines. Some turbine manufacturers also provide operations, maintenance, and performance optimization services for wind power projects. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
    As of 2016, the top three wind turbine manufacturers, measured by shares of cumulative installed capacity of the U.S. wind turbine fleet, are GE Renewable Energy, Vestas, and Siemens. These three manufacturers collectively represent 79% of the U.S. wind turbine market. During 2016, 8,203 MW of wind power capacity was installed in the U.S. Vestas, GE Renewable Energy and Siemens turbines represent 43%, 41.6% and 10.1% of 2016 capacity additions, respectively.<span class="reference" ref="awea_2016b"></span> Figure DI.2 shows the shares of cumulative installed capacity in the U.S. broken down by all manufacturers.

    <p class="paragraph">
    Wind turbine manufacturing is included in "Turbine and Turbine Generator Set Units Manufacturing" (NAICS 333611)<span class="footnote" ref="wind_naics_defs" note="&quot;Turbine and Turbine Generator Set Units Manufacturing&quot; industry (NAICS 333611) comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing turbines (except aircraft); and complete turbine generator set units, such as steam, hydraulic, gas, and wind."></span>.  As reported in the 2012 Economic Census, there are 183 establishments<span class="footnote" ref="wind_est_def" note="An establishment is a single physical location at which business is conducted and/or services are provided. It is not necessarily identical to a company or business enterprise, which may consist of one establishment or more."></span>, 36,955 employees covered under this industry with a value of shipments of 16.9 billion dollars. However, even at the most disaggregated level (six-digit code), this NAICS code covers a range of components, products, and services beyond those specific to wind turbine manufacturing.
